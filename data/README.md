# Data sets

Data sets compiled from in field and laboratory data collection for statistical and spatial analysis in RStudio and ArcGIS.

* [19012024](https://github.com/Alexknob/dissertation_ees/tree/main/data/19012024).
  * **Sample_lab_data_bradan_ak_dis_master_19012024** is the master data sheet of all field and laboratory data collated together based on status of 19.01.2024 
    * **r_anal_19012024** is the codable datasheet from this master sheet
            * *note here that the LOD for the IC data is based on the mean LOD of all 4 runs*
